title: Using Hash#dig

`Hash#dig` is [new in Ruby 2.3.0](http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.3.0_preview1/Hash.html) and you should use it all the time.

My favourite usage is using it to quickly access a deeply nested value in a hash given a path ([from this GOV.UK project](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_schemas_gem/blob/f67a5690e7adbe867635e8dca6301c0628df65c7/lib/govuk_schemas/random_item_generator.rb#L122-L127)).

```ruby
path = "foo.bar.baz"
my_hash = { "foo" => { "bar" => { "baz" => "yisss" } } }
my_hash.dig(*path.split('.'))
# => "yisss"
```
