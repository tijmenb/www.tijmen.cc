Yesterday, I gave a lightning talk at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/). I spoke about the tool I'd built to look for a new flat, using Zoopla and Trello.

You can find [the slides](https://github.com/tijmenb/codebar-mini-houseparty/blob/master/slides.pdf), the [code for the presentation](https://github.com/tijmenb/codebar-mini-houseparty) and the [original code](https://github.com/tijmenb/houseparty) on GitHub.
