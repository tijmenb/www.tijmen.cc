title: My LRUG talk about documentation
date: 2018/03/09

I've previously written about [how we keep developer docs up to date](/2017/07/05/keeping-docs-current.html) on GOV.UK, and how we use [a review system to make it easier](/2017/06/11/docs-review-system.html).

Last November I gave a talk at the [London Ruby User Group (LRUG)](http://lrug.org/) covering the same.

You can [watch it on the Skillsmatter website][skills]. I've put the [slides up on Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/tijmenb/gov-dot-uk-developer-docs):
